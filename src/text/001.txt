In a democratic country, do you think everyone should vote even if they dislike the all the candidates?
Elections need to have a "none of the above" or "no confidence" option with actual consequences if they are to be valid. Just government derives from the consent of the governed, and consent isn't valid if it can't be withdrawn.
My father always said vote, even if it's for the lesser of the two a55 holes
